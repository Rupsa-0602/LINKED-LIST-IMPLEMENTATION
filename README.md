This C program is a simple implementation of a **singly linked list** that allows insertion, deletion, and traversal of nodes through a user-friendly, menu-driven interface. I wrote the code using the **C Programming Editor** and worked on it in **Visual Studio Code** (VS Code), which provided a comfortable environment for writing, testing, and debugging. I used a standard **C/C++ Compiler** to compile and run the program, such as GCC via MinGW. The logic of the program is built around a basic linked list structure using a `struct Node`, where each node contains an integer data value and a pointer to the next node. The `insert` function adds a new node to the end of the list, `delete_node` removes a node containing a specific value, and `traverse` displays the entire list from head to tail. The program ensures safety by checking for invalid input and giving appropriate messages if a value is not found or the list is empty. It also handles dynamic memory allocation and deallocation using `malloc` and `free`, which is essential for managing memory manually in C. This project helped me practice key concepts in data structures, such as pointer manipulation and linked list operations, while also reinforcing input validation and menu-driven programming. It's a great example for beginners learning how to implement and work with linked lists in C.
